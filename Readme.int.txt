                Jurassic Rage: Evolution II Release notes.
========================================================================

In 1993, a team of scientists discovered a way of genetically incubating
a dinosaur. It was decided that the best way to study dinosaurs was to 
let them roam in a natural environment, thus a facility on a small 
island was constructed. By 2001, the scientists had created most 
dinosaurs known to man and began to not only watch and observe them, 
but also test them.

This afternoon, raptor broke out of a top security medical lab and 
escaped into jungle, killing several employees on his way. A few hours 
later, a majority of the velociraptors, roaming the island, started to 
behave in a demented fashion. 

Scientists suspect sabotage and food poisoning. They blamed worker 
incompetence, and low-level security. Security personnel accuses 
scientists of ressurecting a prehistoric virus. The sun has set, and all
communication has gone offline...


Jurassic Rage is an episodic first-person shooter mod for Unreal 
Tournament 2004. We are undertaking the challenge to incorporate fun 
gameplay with a realistic world and an evolving storyline into one 
well-tested and balanced package released every 30 days.

========================================================================
 2.2 Performance
========================================================================

2.2.1 Resolution
--------------

The resolution in which you run the game will have the greatest impact on 
performance if you are not in the lucky position of running the latest 
top of the line graphics cards. Running at 640x480 in 16 bit mode or even 
512x384 in 16 bit mode should provide decent performance even on older 
hardware.

2.2.2 CPU Speed
-------------

The game is also very sensitive to CPU speed, memory bandwidth, and cache
performance. Thus, it runs far better on leading-edge processors like
those of AMD and Intel. See section 1.2 for a guideline on recommended 
specs.

2.2.3 Memory
----------

Unreal Tournament 2004's performance is highly dependent on the amount
of RAM you have in your machine, and the amount of memory that is
available. Machines with less memory will access their hard disk more
frequently to load data, which causes sporadic pauses in gameplay. Thus,
if you have a 128 MByte (or less) machine, you should make sure that
you don't have other unnecessary programs loaded in memory when playing
Unreal Tournament 2004.

2.2.4 Considering upgrading?
--------------------------

For people considering upgrading their machines, here are some tips based
on our experience running Unreal Tournament 2004 on a variety of
machines:

  1 The biggest performance gain in Unreal Tournament 2004 comes from
    having a state of the art graphics chip.

  2 The next upgrade that tends to improve Unreal Tournament 2004 
    performance is upgrading your CPU.

  3 Finally, lots of RAM helps. With memory prices continually falling,
    it's now reasonably affordable to upgrade to 512 MByte of system
    memory.

2.2.5 Getting better performance
------------------------------

By default Unreal Tournament 2004 picks hardware specific default
values the first time you run the game which should result in decent
performance but there is always room left to tweak.

Resolution and texture detail levels have the greatest impact on 
performance, if you have a fast CPU. So you might want to tweak the 
settings to achieve the visual quality / performance tradeoff you 
desire.

If you have a fast graphics card, but a rather slow CPU you might want
to lower the World detail setting in the detail settings menu.

Last but not least, if you have both a fast CPU and a fast graphics
card you shouldn't have to read this :).

========================================================================
 2.3 Troubleshooting
========================================================================

2.3.1 Crashes
------------

If Unreal Tournament 2004 stops with a "Ran out of virtual memory"
message, you need to free up more hard disk space on your primary drive
(C:) in order to play. Unreal Tournament 2004's large levels and rich
textures take up a lot of virtual memory.  We recommend having 500 MByte 
of free hard disk space for running the game.

2.3.2 Sound issues
----------------

If using a 3D sound accelerator such as the Sound Blaster Audigy series 
sound card, you can go into "Options/Audio" to enable EAX by selecting
the "Hardware 3D Sound + EAX" options.

You need to upgrade to the latest version of Sound Blaster Audigy drivers 
in order to get acceptable 3D sound performance.

Using Unreal Tournament 2004 in conjunction with earlier versions of the
drivers MAY cause severe performance problems (major slowdowns in the
order of 30-50% while playing sound) in which case you should change the
option back to the default "Software 3D Audio".

If your computer is hooked up to a 5.1 speaker system, you should go into
"Options" and turn on "Hardware 3D Audio" to take advantage of 360-degree 
sound panning, which rocks.

There also is a safe mode available in case you run into any audio 
related problems like glitches/ hitches/ static or bad performance if
sound is enabled.

2.3.3 Network play issues
-----------------------

The minimum speed connection for acceptable Internet play performance is
a 33.3K modem connection to your Internet Service Provider.

Known network play issues:

  * When a new player enters a network game, clients may experience a
    1/4-second pause while the mesh, skin, and other data is loaded for
    that player. This is by design.

  * Unreal Tournament 2004's Internet play performance is highly
    dependent on the bandwidth of your connection, the latency (ping
    time), and the packet loss.  The game is designed to be playable up
    to 300 msec ping times, 5% packet loss, and 33.3K connection speeds.
    Performance degrades heavily under worse latency, packet loss, and
    bandwidth connections.

2.3.4 Control issues
------------------

Some PC keyboards can't recognize certain combinations of 3 or more
simultaneously pressed keys.

2.3.5 Direct3D
-----------------

Please ensure that you are running the latest drivers for your graphics
card as Unreal Tournament 2004 stresses the hardware and drivers to a
greater extent than most available games and we rely on a number of
bug fixes hardware vendors incorporated into their latest drivers. To
obtain the latest drivers please visit the website of your graphics
card manufacturer.

2.3.6  TNT2 / Kyro II / Voodoo 3 issues
-------------------------------------

Due to the lack of certain key functionality like texture compression and
cubemap support TNT2, Kyro II, Voodoo 3, G400, ... cards won't be able
to run the game at the full visual quality. As uncompressed textures are
much larger than the compressed ones we have to drastically scale down
both size and color depth of the textures in order to fit them into video
memory. This means you will notice banding artifacts - especially in the 
menus. 

The lack of cubemap support means that reflections won't look correct 
though during gameplay you'll most likely be hard pressed to spot the 
difference.

2.3.7 OpenGL
-----------

The OpenGL renderer is not officially supported on Windows but could be 
a good choice on certain hardware / driver combinations as it might 
trigger fewer bugs in drivers. Unless you are experiencing serious visual 
flaws there is no reason to change to the OpenGL renderer though. Unlike 
Unreal Tournament, Unreal Tournament 2004 was designed around D3D and 
offers the best performance and visual quality with the D3D renderer.

Also please keep in mind that the OpenGL renderer has higher system 
requirements than the D3D renderer. The OpenGL renderer is known to 
not work correctly with pre-7.76 ATI drivers.

2.3.8 Obtaining DirectX 9.0b
---------------------------

DirectX 9.0b will be included on the retail CD and be downloaded from
the below URL if it is not already installed on your system.

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/default.aspx

2.3.9 Game is starting up windowed
---------------------------------

If the game fails to obtain keyboard focus when launching it will start
up windowed. In this case you can click on the window and press ALT-ENTER
to switch to fullscreen mode.

2.3.10 Software rendering
------------------------

You can have the game pick sensible default settings for software 
rendering by launching it with the -software command line argument. This
will also pick the software renderer as the render device which is 
useful if you run into driver issues or don't have a 3D accelerated 
graphics card.

   ut2004 -software -mod=JurassicRage

2.3.11 Logitech Mice
---------------------

If you're experiencing difficulty in assigning commands to your Logitech mouse's
extra buttons (middle button, side buttons, etc.) and you've installed the
MouseWare software, you might try adding the following registry entry. 

Under "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> Software -> Logitech -> MouseWare -> CurrentVersion
-> GamingCompatibility" add a new string named "Unreal2004" with the value being set
to the game's location. The default entry for this would be "c:\UT2004\System\UT2004.EXE".
If you're uncertain about this, please contact Logitech technical support 
(http://www.logitech.com/).

========================================================================
 2.4 Dedicated Network Servers
========================================================================

2.4.1 Explanation
---------------

For optimal network play performance, you can launch a dedicated copy of
the Unreal Tournament 2004 server on a computer. This improves performance
compared to using a non-dedicated server but, of course, since it ties up 
the PC.

Anybody may freely run dedicated servers on the Internet; you don't need
to get permission or fill out any paperwork.  

2.4.2 Launching
-------------

You can launch a dedicated server by going through the regular Unreal
Tournament 2004 menu, select "Host Multiplayer Game | Game & Map, setting
the appropriate options under the 'Server' tab, being sure to check
'Dedicated Server'. This is what you'll want to do for quick LAN games
where you have an extra machine sitting around that can act as a
dedicated server.

Alternatively, you can launch a dedicated server from the command line by
running ut2004.exe directly (which usually resides in the
c:\UT2004\System directory, or the System subdirectory of
whatever other directory you installed the game in).  For example, to
launch the level "DM-Rankin", run:

   ucc server DM-Rankin.ut2 -mod=JurassicRage

2.4.3 Multiple Servers Per Machine
--------------------------------

Each copy of the dedicated server can serve one and only one level at a
time.

However, you can run multiple level servers on one machine. To do this,
you must give each server a unique TCP/IP port number. The default port
number is 7777. To specify a port, use the following type of command
line:

   ucc server DM-Rankin.ut2 port=7778 -mod=JurassicRage
